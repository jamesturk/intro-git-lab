# CAPP Camp Git Lab

Like yesterday's lab, today's lab will ask you to take some steps with git and run a `check.py` script as you go.

Additionally, today you'll be submitting at the end via Gradescope-- a tool used in many classes.

Don't worry, we won't be grading your work, submitting is merely to help you get acquainted with tools you'll be using in many classes.

## Part 1 - Making a First Commit

Whenever you have made a change that you wish to keep, you'll make a git commit.

Open up 'part1.txt' using `code` and answer the questions.

When you've done so, add a commit with the message "part 1 done!"

Run `python3 check.py 1` to check that your commit exists and is correct.

## Part 2 - Making & Reverting Changes with `git revert`

Open up the file 'part2.txt' and make the modifications it describes. (Do not commit them yet!)

Run the command `python3 check.py 2` which will verify that these changes are made.

Once you've run this command, revert the changes and run `python3 check.py 2` again.

## Part 3 - Viewing Changes with `git diff`

Run the command `python3 changes.py` this will make some changes to your local files, but will not commit them. (Do not commit them either!)

Then take a look at these changes with `git diff`, open up part3.txt and answer the questions based on the changes you see.

Be sure to commit your changes! There is no `check.py` step for this part.

## Part 4 - Submitting to Gradescope
